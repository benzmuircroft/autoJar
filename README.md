based on but not as advance js as https://github.com/lejeunerenard/autobase-manager/blob/main/index.js

goal:

to use corestore and be fully aware of all cores added and have the storage index update to the latest version when back online

it must show who-is-who as a service

and give you reader access and indexablity with no effort

it must also later let users swap roles


what i want it for:

  todo: ...


  methods:

  getIdex

  readCore

  becomeCore (must be authed ???)
